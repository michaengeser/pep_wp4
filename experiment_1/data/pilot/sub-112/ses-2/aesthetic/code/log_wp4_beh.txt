PTB-INFO: The detected endline of the vertical blank interval is equal or lower than the startline. This indicates
PTB-INFO: that i couldn't detect the duration of the vertical blank interval and won't be able to correct timestamps
PTB-INFO: for it. This will introduce a very small and constant offset (typically << 1 msec). Read 'help BeampositionQueries'
PTB-INFO: for how to correct this, should you really require that last few microseconds of precision.
PTB-INFO: Btw. this can also mean that your systems beamposition queries are slightly broken. It may help timing precision to
PTB-INFO: enable the beamposition workaround, as explained in 'help ConserveVRAMSettings', section 'kPsychUseBeampositionQueryWorkaround'.

PTB-INFO: Reported monitor refresh interval from operating system = 16.666667 ms [60.000000 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Small deviations between reported values are normal and no reason to worry.
PTB-INFO: ==============================================================================================================================
PTB-INFO: WINDOWS DWM DESKTOP COMPOSITOR IS ACTIVE. On this Windows-10 or later system, Psychtoolbox can no longer reliably detect if
PTB-INFO: this will cause trouble for timing and integrity of visual stimuli or not. You might be just fine, or you could be in trouble.
PTB-INFO: Use external measurement equipment and independent procedures to verify reliability of timing if you care about proper timing.
PTB-INFO: ==============================================================================================================================

WARNING: Couldn't compute a reliable estimate of monitor refresh interval! Trouble with VBL syncing?!?


----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! -----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.



WARNING: Failed to load GetCharJava Java class. Most likely your Matlab
WARNING: classpath.txt file is not up to date. I will try to auto-fix this for
WARNING: the current session by executing the PsychJavaTrouble() command.
WARNING: This may have bad side-effects, like clearing all your scripts variables
WARNING: and functions! If it works, please read 'help PsychJavaTrouble'
WARNING: for a proper and permanent fix to the problem.

PsychJavaTrouble: Will now try to add the PsychJava folder to Matlabs dynamic classpath...
PsychJavaTrouble: Added PsychJava folder to dynamic class path. Psychtoolbox Java commands should work now!
INFO: Problem may be fixed for this session. Let's see...
INFO: Yep! Still, please fix the problem properly asap.


PTB-ERROR: Screen('Flip'); beamposition timestamping computed an *impossible stimulus onset value* of 952805.808578 secs, which would indicate that
PTB-ERROR: stimulus onset happened *before* it was actually requested! (Earliest theoretically possible 952805.809969 secs).

PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): rawTimestamp = 952805.814817, scanline = 405
PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): line_pre_swaprequest = 78, line_post_swaprequest = 122, time_post_swaprequest = 952805.810621
PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): preflip_vblcount = 0, preflip_vbltimestamp = 952805.808765
PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): postflip_vblcount = 0, postflip_vbltimestamp = -1.000000, vbltimestampquery_retrycount = 0

PTB-ERROR: This error can be due to either of the following causes:
PTB-ERROR: Very unlikely: Something is broken in your systems beamposition timestamping. I've disabled high precision
PTB-ERROR: timestamping for now. Returned timestamps will be less robust and accurate.

PTB-ERROR: The most likely cause would be that Synchronization of stimulus onset (buffer swap) to the
PTB-ERROR: vertical blank interval VBL is not working properly, or swap completion signalling to PTB is broken.
PTB-ERROR: Please run the script PerceptualVBLSyncTest to check this. With non-working sync to VBL, all stimulus timing
PTB-ERROR: is futile. Also run OSXCompositorIdiocyTest on macOS. Also read 'help SyncTrouble' !

PTB-INFO: There are still 224 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO: This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO: textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO: via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO: stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO: timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO: crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 126 times out of a total of 3100 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.



WARNING: This session of your experiment was run by you with the setting Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1).
WARNING: This means that some internal self-tests and calibrations were skipped. Your stimulus presentation timing
WARNING: may have been wrong. This is fine for development and debugging of your experiment, but for running the real

PTB-INFO: Btw. this can also mean that your systems beamposition queries are slightly broken. It may help timing precision to

WARNING: Couldn't compute a reliable estimate of monitor refresh interval! Trouble with VBL syncing?!?


----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! -----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.

WARNING: Couldn't compute a reliable estimate of monitor refresh interval! Trouble with VBL syncing?!?


----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! -----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.

PTB-ERROR: Screen('Flip'); beamposition timestamping computed an *impossible stimulus onset value* of 958165.955549 secs, which would indicate that
PTB-ERROR: stimulus onset happened *before* it was actually requested! (Earliest theoretically possible 958165.967092 secs).

PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): rawTimestamp = 958165.969173, scanline = 882

PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): postflip_vblcount = 0, postflip_vbltimestamp = -1.000000, vbltimestampquery_retrycount = 0

PTB-ERROR: This error can be due to either of the following causes:
PTB-ERROR: Very unlikely: Something is broken in your systems beamposition timestamping. I've disabled high precision
PTB-ERROR: timestamping for now. Returned timestamps will be less robust and accurate.

PTB-ERROR: The most likely cause would be that Synchronization of stimulus onset (buffer swap) to the
PTB-ERROR: vertical blank interval VBL is not working properly, or swap completion signalling to PTB is broken.
PTB-ERROR: Please run the script PerceptualVBLSyncTest to check this. With non-working sync to VBL, all stimulus timing
PTB-ERROR: is futile. Also run OSXCompositorIdiocyTest on macOS. Also read 'help SyncTrouble' !

PTB-INFO: There are still 226 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO: This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO: textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO: via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO: stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO: timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO: crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 3 times out of a total of 37 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the

PTB-INFO: you can disable the sync test via call to Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 2); .
PTB-INFO: You won't get proper stimulus onset timestamps in any case though, so windowed mode is of limited use.

PTB-INFO: The detected endline of the vertical blank interval is equal or lower than the startline. This indicates
PTB-INFO: that i couldn't detect the duration of the vertical blank interval and won't be able to correct timestamps
PTB-INFO: for it. This will introduce a very small and constant offset (typically << 1 msec). Read 'help BeampositionQueries'
PTB-INFO: for how to correct this, should you really require that last few microseconds of precision.
PTB-INFO: Btw. this can also mean that your systems beamposition queries are slightly broken. It may help timing precision to
PTB-INFO: enable the beamposition workaround, as explained in 'help ConserveVRAMSettings', section 'kPsychUseBeampositionQueryWorkaround'.

----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! -----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.

PTB-ERROR: Screen('Flip'); beamposition timestamping computed an *impossible stimulus onset value* of 960510.621247 secs, which would indicate that
PTB-ERROR: stimulus onset happened *before* it was actually requested! (Earliest theoretically possible 960510.626651 secs).

PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): rawTimestamp = 960510.629985, scanline = 566
PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): line_pre_swaprequest = 341, line_post_swaprequest = 377, time_post_swaprequest = 960510.627184
PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): preflip_vblcount = 0, preflip_vbltimestamp = 960510.621385
PTB-ERROR: Some more diagnostic values (only for experts): postflip_vblcount = 0, postflip_vbltimestamp = -1.000000, vbltimestampquery_retrycount = 0

PTB-ERROR: This error can be due to either of the following causes:
PTB-ERROR: Very unlikely: Something is broken in your systems beamposition timestamping. I've disabled high precision
PTB-ERROR: timestamping for now. Returned timestamps will be less robust and accurate.

PTB-ERROR: The most likely cause would be that Synchronization of stimulus onset (buffer swap) to the
PTB-ERROR: vertical blank interval VBL is not working properly, or swap completion signalling to PTB is broken.
PTB-ERROR: Please run the script PerceptualVBLSyncTest to check this. With non-working sync to VBL, all stimulus timing
PTB-ERROR: is futile. Also run OSXCompositorIdiocyTest on macOS. Also read 'help SyncTrouble' !
